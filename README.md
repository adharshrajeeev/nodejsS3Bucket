# Private S3 Bucket with CloudFront Distribution Example

This repository provides an example implementation of creating a private S3 bucket and accessing it via a CloudFront distribution using an Express server. The server makes an API call to obtain a signed URL with a 5-minute expiry time to an image file uploaded on the S3 bucket.
